# Core Java excercises
This is repository for excercises from 'Core Java for the Impatient' book by Cay S. Horstmann

### Chapter 1
1. Write a program that reads an integer and prints it in binary, octal, and hexadecimal.
2. Write a program that reads an integer angle (which may be positive or negative) and normalizes it to a value between 0 and 359 degrees. Try it first with the % operator, then with floorMod.
3. Using only the conditional operator, write a program that reads three integers and prints the largest. Repeat with Math.max.
4. Write a program that prints the smallest and largest positive double value.
5. What happens when you cast a double to an int that is larger than the largest possible int value?
6. Write a program that computes the factorial n! = 1 x 2 x ... x n, using BigInteger. Compute the factorial of 1000.
7. Write a program that reads in two numbers between 0 and 65535, stores them in short variables, and computes their unsigned sum, difference, product, quotient, and remainder, without converting them to int.
8. Write a program that reads a string and prints all of its nonempty substrings.
9. 
10. Write a program that produces a random string of letters and digits by generating a random long value and printing it in base 36.
11. Write a program that reads a line of text and prints all characters that are not ASCII, together with their Unicode values.
12. 
13. Write a program that prints a lottery combination, picking six distinct numbers between 1 and 49. To pick six distinct numbers, start with an array list filled with 1 ... 49. Pick a random index and remove the element. Repeat six times. Print the result in sorted order.
14. Write a program that reads a two-dimensional array of integers and determines whether it is a magic square (that is, whether the sum of all rows, all columns, and all the diagonals is the same). Accept lines of input that youbreak  up into individual integers, and stop when the user enters a blank line,
15. Write a program that stores Pascal's triangle up to a given n in an ArrayList<ArrayList<Integer>>.
